- Need indicator at bottom of screen if leads to death!! <- Simply rect check all the way down. (Crossed out arrow?)
- Enemies are way too chaotic with springs, maybe make it less often
- Certain routes from level 2 unwinnable
- Bullets at start of level 2 should be manditory(?)

COMPLETED
- Bullets knock down ciribot if he jumps up into them. Fun, but unintended things tend to have messy cases.
Resolution: dont make them solid
